Build a To-Do List App

Objective
Build a simple To-Do List application that allows users to create, update and delete tasks. The application should be built using React, Node.js and TypeScript.

Requirements
The application should have two pages - a "Home" page that displays a list of tasks and an "Add Task" page that allows users to add new tasks.
The "Home" page should display a list of tasks that includes the task's name and status (e.g. "Complete", "Incomplete").
Users should be able to mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
Users should be able to delete tasks from the list.
The "Add Task" page should have a form that allows users to enter a new task name and status.
The application should use a RESTful API to handle data requests.
All code should be written in TypeScript.
The front-end should be built using React and the back-end should be built using Node.js.

Technical Details
You may use any front-end or back-end libraries or frameworks you wish, but the core of the application must be built using React and Node.js.
The application should be responsive and work on all screen sizes.
The application should be styled using CSS.
The application should be deployed to a public URL (e.g. Heroku, Netlify, etc.).
You should include a README file that explains how to run the application locally and any other details you feel are necessary.

Bonus Features
If you finish the above requirements with time to spare, you can add additional features to the application. Here are some suggestions:
Add user authentication (e.g. allow users to create accounts, log in, and view their own tasks).
Allow users to filter tasks by status (e.g. "Complete", "Incomplete").
Allow users to sort tasks by name or status.
Add search functionality to allow users to search for tasks by name.
Add a feature to allow users to edit existing tasks.
